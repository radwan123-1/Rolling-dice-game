# Rolling-dice-game
In this simple python project, i made a simple dice roll program using Python.

It is a simple program and you will gain knowledge about strings. Apart from this, i used random module to generate the dice numbers randomly

We also use tkinter library as recommended to create a graphical user gui interface, the user just need to click on (roll a dice) button which will generate a random number between 1 and 6 and a dice shaped figure.
